My expectation for this subject is pretty high since we have Sir Capuchino as our teacher. I expect to learn a lot and hope to absorb all the lesson sir will give us. As of now, I am having fun figuring out this git stuff that we're doing so I'm very excited to go through this course.

I agree to this statement, Riggs. Me too, I feel that also HAHAHAHHAHA <3
